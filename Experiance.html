									<h1>My<br />
									Experiance</h1>
									<p>Having stood on the yellow footprints at Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego<br>
										and swore to an oath to serve my country, I pushed my mind and body beyond what<br>
										I though was possible. These lessons I learned in the U.S.M.C. have been the <br>
										foundation in which I have built myself:</p>
									<h3>Honor. Courage. Commitment.</h3>

								<p>Who am I? Having spent much of my life in the Sierra Nevada Mountains near Tahoe National Forest, California. I have learned from a young age that hard work can reap great rewards. I began working at 13 years old at Camp Alta as a dishwasher and over the years my responsibilities included groundskeeping, prep cook and others. I left after I turned 18 to begin my college education at Simpson University in Redding, CA. I spent over two years working and going to school, but struggled to settle on a major. So I decided to put my education on hold to experience the world around me.</p>
								<p>I spent my summers breaks from college working as a laborer for an asphalt company. During a slow summer, I struggled to maintain fulltime hours, so I decided furthered my knowledge in the construction field by becoming an electrician’s apprentice. Like a fish to water, I took to it and learned at a rapid rate. I decided to relocate to Washington State after getting married and landed a job at Lowe’s as a Department Manager. This job was quite an experience for me, but I felt the call to do more with my life. Following the family tradition of military service, I left and enlisted in the United States Marine Corps. I successfully completed bootcamp and  earned the title of Marine then went to work on the AV-8B aircraft as an Avionics Technician.</p>
								<p>During my enlistment an injury was incurred, I was discharged, and I had to reinvent myself for a job market that was freefall during the Great Recession. I went back to school at Green River College with a new perspective on the value of a college education. Having lived on the outskirts of the Tahoe National Forest for most of my life, what better way to direct my education than working towards a degree in Natural Resources. I also ventured into professional photography as a side business, and still practice this craft today. I was not able to finish my degree as money was tight and I needed a steady income.</p>
								<p>I moved my family and I back to California and landed a position as a machine operator for a cider company. I spent my time there studying and later reworking the machine I used to double its intended production. I did not stop there, as the knowledge I obtained was too valuable to be horded. I took it upon to author and illustrate an operator’s manual that I used to trained other machine operators. After a couple years, I transferred from the production line an into a brewer’s position. Here I used my ability to learn rapidly and became great at making cider. Having made some of the best hard apple and pear ciders I could not have been more thrilled. But all good thing must come to an end and after the sale and transition of the business to Miller Coors I was let go.</p>
								<p>Due to the slow economy and winter months, jobs were scarce. I leaned on my training in the USMC and grit obtained in my life to adapt and overcome and found work in warehousing. I spent that time building relationships with customers while creating more efficient ways to manage the daily shipping and receiving. I was successful in creating an environment that was more efficient and streamlined.</p>
								<p>The desire to finish my formal education was still there, so I took a risk to move my family to Washington again to complete my degrees in Natural Resource Management. During my time at Green River College, I found myself drawn to GIS and how it can support the management of our forests and other natural resources. I decided to press further and now I am currently working hard towards completing my <a href="https://www.tacoma.uw.edu/urban-studies/ms-program-overview" target="_blank">Masters in Geospatial Technology at the University of Washington – Tacoma</a>.</p>

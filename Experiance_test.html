									<h1>My<br />
									Experiance</h1>
									<p>Having stood on the yellow footprints at Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego<br>
										and swore to an oath to serve my country, I pushed my mind and body beyond what<br>
										I though was possible. These lessons I learned in the U.S.M.C. have been the <br>
										foundation in which I have built myself:</p>
									<h3>Honor. Courage. Commitment.</h3>

								<p>Who am I? Having spent much of my life in the Sierra Nevada Mountains near Tahoe National Forest, I have learned from a young age that hard work will reap great rewards, and that you are defined by your actions not the job. I began working at 13 years old at Camp Alta, CA as a dishwasher and later groundskeeper and prep cook. I left at 18 to begin my college education. Having spent some time at school I felt that I need more than just an education but to experience the world around me.</p>
								<p>I spent the next three summers working as a laborer for an asphalt company. During a slow summer I needed to maintain fulltime hours, so I decided furthered my knowledge in the construction field by becoming an electrician’s apprentice. Like a fish to water, I took to it and learned at a rapid rate the craft that later was applied to my time in the Marine Corps. I earned the title of Marine and went to work on the AV-8B aircraft as an Avionics Technician.</p>
								<p>During my enlistment an injury was incurred, I was discharged, and I had to reinvent myself for a job market that was freefall during the Great Recession. I went back to school for a couple years at Green River College and worked towards a degree in Natural Resources. Having lived on the outskirts of the Tahoe National Forest for most of my life, what better way to direct my education. I also ventured into professional photography as a side business, and still practice this craft today. I was not able to finish my degree as money was tight and I needed a steady income.</p>
								<p>I moved my family and I back to California and landed a position as a machine operator for a cider company. I spent my time there studying and later reworking the machine I used to double its intended production. I did not stop there as the knowledge I obtained was too valuable to be kept, so I authored an operator’s manual and trained other machine operators. I transferred from the production line an into a brewer’s position. Here I used my skills to learn rapidly to become great at my craft. Having made some of the best hard apple and pear ciders I could not have been more thrilled. But all good thing must come to an end and after the sale and transition of the business to Miller Coors I was let go.</p>
								<p>Due to the economy and winter months, jobs were scarce. I leaned on my training in the USMC and grit obtained in my life to adapt and overcome and found work in warehousing. I spent that time building relationships with customers while creating more efficient ways to manage the daily shipping and receiving. I was successful in creating an environment that was more efficient and streamlined.</p>
								<p>The persistent desire to finish my formal education was still there, so I took a risk to move my family to Washington again to complete my degrees in Natural Resource Management. During my time at Green River College, I found myself drawn to GIS and how it can support the management of our forests and other natural resources. I decided to press further and now I am currently working hard towards completing my <a href="https://www.tacoma.uw.edu/urban-studies/ms-program-overview" target="_blank">Masters in Geospatial Technology at the University of Washington – Tacoma</a>.</p>
